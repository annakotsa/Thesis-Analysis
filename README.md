# Thesis-Analysis

Thesis-Analysis is a repository of Anna Kotsa and it contains the code and the data used for the research methodology of her thesis, as well as the required packages that need to be imported.

The purpose of this repository is to allow anyone to reproduce the notebook Thesis Analysis exactly as I did in order to reach the conclusions described in my final thesis.

## Dependencies

The libraries that need to be imported in order to successfully reproduce this notebook are mentioned in the file `requirements.txt`

## Data

Data Source: Startup Investments (Justinas Cirtautas) - Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/justinas/startup-investments).

There are two more `.csv` files contained in the initial dataset:  `objects.csv` and `relationships.csv`. Due to their file size, it was not possible to upload them in this repository, therefore you need to download the whole dataset from the link above if you wish to access them.

## Code reproduction

In order to reproduce the notebook, you need to have installed the Anaconda platform so as to have access to the Anaconda command Prompt. 
You can access the Thesis Analysis notebook by opening Jupyter Notebook from Anaconda Prompt.
